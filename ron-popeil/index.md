Ashlee Vance of [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk) has recently [compared me](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/08/dtrace_user_take/) to infamous kitchen gadget pitchman [Ron Popeil](http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_10_30_a_pitchman.htm). Let me clear up two misconceptions that have apparently arisen from this comparison. First, despite some claims to the contrary, [DTrace](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace) cannot be used to make turkey-jerky. And second, the rumors of a DTrace infomercial starring [Tom Vu](http://infomercial.tvheaven.com/tomvu.htm) are absolutely false. (That said, it _is_ true that many have used DTrace to work their way up from lowly busboys to yacht-owning multi-millionaires...)
