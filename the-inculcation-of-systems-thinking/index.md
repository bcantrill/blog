As is known but perhaps not widely reported, all three of us on Team DTrace are products of [Brown University Computer Science](http://www.cs.brown.edu/). More specifically, we were all students in (and later TAs for) Brown's operating systems course, [CS169](http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs169/). This course has been taught by the same professor, [Tom Doeppner](http://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/twd.html), over its thirty year lifetime, and has become something of a legend in Silicon Valley, having produced some of the top engineers at major companies like NetApp, SGI, Adobe, and VMware -- not to mention tons of smaller companies. And at Sun, CS169 has cast a particularly long shadow, with seven CS169 alums ([Adam](http://blogs.sun.com/ahl), [Dan](http://blogs.sun.com/dp), [Dave](http://blogs.sun.com/dep), [Eric](http://blogs.sun.com/eschrock), [Matt](http://blogs.sun.com/ahrens), [Mike](http://blogs.sun.com/mws) and me) having together played major roles in developing many of the revolutionary technologies in Solaris 10 (specifically, [DTrace](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/), [ZFS](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/), [SMF](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/smf/), [FMA](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/fm/) and [Zones](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zones/)).

I mention the Brown connection because this past Thursday, Brown hosted a [symposium](http://www.cs.brown.edu/industry/ipp/symposia/ipp37/) to honor both the DTrace team in particular and the contributions of former CS169 undergraduate TAs more generally. We were each invited to give a presentation on a topic of our choosing, and seizing the opportunity for intellectual indulgence, I chose to reflect on a broad topic: [the inculcation of systems thinking](http://dtrace.org/resources/bmc/systems.pdf). My thoughts on this topic deserve their own lengthy blog entry, but this presentation will have to suffice for now -- albeit stripped of the references to the [Tupolev Tu-144](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-144), LBJ, Ray Kurzweil, the [737 rudder reversal](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/news/local/737/) and Ruby stack backtraces that peppered (or perhaps polluted?) the actual talk...
