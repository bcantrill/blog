title: "Demoâ€™ing DTrace"
date: "2004-08-05"

With my explanation of a [demo gone wrong](/2004/07/26/demo-perils), several people have asked me the more general question: how does one demo [DTrace](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace)? This question doesn't have a single answer, especially given that DTrace is best demonstrated with _ad hoc_ queries of the system. Indeed, the best demos are when someone in the audience shouts out their own question that they want to see answered: answering such a question instantly with DTrace nearly always blows away the questioner -- who has presumably suffered in the past trying to answer similar questions. Of course, saying "why, there are many ways to demo to DTrace!" is a useless answer to the question of how one demos DTrace; while there are many ways that one _can_ demo DTrace, it's useful to get a flavor of how a typical demo might go. So with the substantial caveat that this is not _the_ way to demo DTrace, but merely _a_ way, let me walk you through an example demo.

It all starts by running [dtrace](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kq0f?a=view)(1M) without any arguments:

```
# dtrace
Usage: dtrace [-32|-64] [-aACeEFGHlqSvVwZ] [-b bufsz] [-c cmd] [-D name[=def]]

        -P  enable or list probes matching the specified provider name
        -q  set quiet mode (only output explicitly traced data)
        -s  enable or list probes according to the specified D script
        -S  print D compiler intermediate code
        -U  undefine symbol when invoking preprocessor
        -v  set verbose mode (report program stability attributes)
        -V  report DTrace API version
        -w  permit destructive actions
        -x  enable or modify compiler and tracing options
        -X  specify ISO C conformance settings for preprocessor
        -Z  permit probe descriptions that match zero probes

```

I usually just point out this just gives your typical Unix-ish help message -- implicitly making the point that dipping into DTrace doesn't require much more than typing its name on the command line. From the output of the usage message, I highlight the "-l" option, noting that it lists all the probes in the system. I then run with that option -- being sure to pipe the output to [more](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9jd?a=view)(1):

I point out that each of these rows is a point of instrumentation. I then explain each of the columns, explaining that the `PROVIDER` column denotes the DTrace notion of [instrumentation providers](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlef?a=view) which allows for disjoint instrumentation techniques. If the audience is a particularly savvy one, I may point out that the [`lockstat` provider](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidllf?a=view) is a recasting of the instrumentation technique used by [lockstat](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5166/6mbb1kq58?a=view)(1M), and that `lockstat` has been made to be a DTrace consumer. I mention that the `MODULE` column contains the name of the kernel module (in the case of a kernel probe) or shared object name (in the case of a user-level probe), that the `FUNCTION` column contains the function that the probe is in, and that the `NAME` column contains the name of the probe. I explain that a each probe is uniquely identified by the probe _tuple_: provider, module, function and name.

Scrolling down through the output, I point out the probes from [`syscall` provider](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidln3?a=view), describing its ability to instrument every system call entry and return. (For some audiences, I may pause here to remind them of the definition of a [system call](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5167/6mbb2jaet?a=view).)

I then continue to scroll down my probe listing until I get to output that looks something like this:

```

I pause here to explain that the [`fbt` provider](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlmf?a=view) can instrument every function entry and return in the kernel. Making the observation that there are quite a few functions in the kernel, I then quit out of the output, and re-run the command -- this time piping the output through [`wc`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9r8?a=view). Usually, the output is something like this:

```
# dtrace -l | wc -l
   32521

```

Anyone who has dealt with [traditional instrumentation frameworks](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5174/6mbb98ujq?a=view) will typically express some shock at this -- that there are (for example) 32,520 points of instrumentation on an optimized, stock system. Occasionally, someone who has perhaps heard of DTrace may pipe up: "Is that where that 30,000 number comes from that I've seen in in the [press](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/15/sun_starts_solaris_10_salutations/)?" The quick answer is that this is indeed where that number comes from -- but the longer answer is that this really only the beginning because with the [`pid` provider](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidloa?a=view), DTrace can instrument _every instruction in every running app_. For perhaps obvious reasons, we create these `pid` probes lazily -- we don't want to clog up the system with millions of unused probes.

After having listed all probes and counted them, my next invocation of `dtrace` is to list the probes yet again -- but this time listing only probes that match the probe tuple "`syscall:::entry"`. I explain that this means I want to match probes from the [`syscall` provider](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidln3?a=view) named `entry` -- and that I don't care about the module and function. This output is simply a shorter version of the previous listing:

```
# dtrace -l -n syscall:::entry
   ID   PROVIDER            MODULE                          FUNCTION NAME
   27    syscall                                               nosys entry
   29    syscall                                               rexit entry
   31    syscall                                             forkall entry
   33    syscall                                                read entry
   35    syscall                                               write entry
   37    syscall                                                open entry
   39    syscall                                               close entry
   41    syscall                                                wait entry
...

```

I then explain that to _enable_ these probes (instead of just listing them), I need to merely not include the "`-l`":

```

I let this run on the screen for a while, explaining that we've gone from an optimized, uninstrumented system call table to an instrumented one -- and that we're now seeing every system call as it happens on the box. I explain that (on the one hand) this is novel information: in Solaris, we haven't had a way to get system call information _for the entire system_. (I often remind the audience that this may look similar to [`truss`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9q3?a=view) , but it's really quite different: `truss` operates only on a single process, and has an enormous probe effect from constantly stopping and running the target process.)

But while this information may be novel (at least for Solaris), it's actually not that valuable -- merely knowing that we executed these systems calls is unlikely to be terrible helpful. Rather, we may like to know which _applications_ are inducing these system calls. To do this, we add a clause in the DTrace control language, D. The clause we need to add is quite simple; we're going to use the [`trace`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlir?a=view) action to record the current application name, which is stored in [`execname`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlg1?a=view) variable. So I `^C` the previous enabling, and run the following:

```
# dtrace -n syscall:::entry'{trace(execname)}'
dtrace: description 'syscall:::entry' matched 226 probes

This is clearly more useful: we can see which _apps_ are performing system calls. But seeing this also leads to a very important observation, one that some heckler in a savvy audience may have already made by now: what we're seeing in the above output is the system calls to write all of this gunk out to the terminal. That is, if we were to take this output and [`cut`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9dg?a=view) it, [`sort`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9og?a=view) it, [`uniq`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5165/6mbb0m9qf?a=view) it, and `sort` it again, we would come to the conclusion that `dtrace`, `xterm` and `Xsun` were the problem -- regardless of what was being executed on the machine.

This is a serious problem, and the DTrace solution represents a substantial difference from virtually all earler work in this domain: in DTrace, the aggregation of data is a first-class citizen. Instead of aggregating data postmortem with traditional Unix tools, DTrace allows data to be aggregated _in situ_. This aggregation can reduce the data flow by up to a factor of the number of data points -- a tremendous savings of both space and time.

So to recast the example in terms of aggregations, we want to aggregate on the application name, with our aggregating action being to count:

```
# dtrace -n syscall:::entry'{@[execname] = count()}'
dtrace: description 'syscall:::entry' matched 226 probes

```

When we run the above, we don't see any output -- just that we matched some number of probes. I explain that behind the scenes, we're just keeping a table of application name, and the count of system calls. Whenever we `^C` the above, we get the answer:

```

```

I often point out that in DTrace -- as in good cocktail conversation -- the answer to one question typically provokes the next question. Looking at the above output, we may have all sorts of questions. For example, we may well ask: what the hell is [`dhcpagent`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-0690/6mgflnt8b?a=view) doing? To answer this question, we can add a [predicate](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlel?a=view) to our clause:

```
# dtrace -n syscall:::entry'/execname == "dhcpagent"/{@[probefunc] = count()}'

```

The predicate is contained between the forward slashes; the expression in the curly braces is only evaluated if the predicate evaluates to a non-zero value. And note that we have changed the tuple on which we are aggregating: instead of aggregating on `execname` (which, thanks to the predicate, will always be "`dhcpagent`"), we're aggregating on the `probefunc`. For the `syscall` provider, the `probefunc` is the name of the system call.

Running the above for ten seconds or so, and then `^C`'ing yields the following (at least on my laptop):

```
^C

  pollsys                                                           3
  close                                                             3
  open                                                              3
  lwp_sigmask                                                       6
  fstat64                                                           6
  read                                                             12
  ioctl                                                            12
  llseek                                                           15

```

Now, we may be interested in drilling down more into one of these system calls. Let's say we want to know what `dhcpagent` is doing when it performs an [open](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5167/6mbb2jahi?a=view). We can effect this by narrowing our enabling a bit: instead of enabling _all_ `syscall` probes named `entry`, we want to enable only those probes that are also from the function named `open`. We want to keep our predicate that the `execname` is `dhcpagent`, but this time we don't want to aggregate on the `probefunc` (which, thanks to the narrowed enabling, will always be "`open`"); we want to aggregate on the name of the file that is being opened -- which is the first argument to the `open` system call. To do this, we'll aggregate on `arg0`. For [slightly arcane reasons](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlot?a=view), we need to use the [`copyinstr`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlj1?a=view) action to effect this. The enabling:

```
# dtrace -n syscall::open:entry'/execname == "dhcpagent"/{@[copyinstr(arg0)] = count()}'
dtrace: description 'syscall::open:entry' matched 1 probe

```

Again, running the above for about ten seconds:

```
^C

  /etc/default/dhcpagent                                            4

```

This tells us that there were four calls to the `open` system call from `dhcpagent` -- and that all four were to the same file. Just on the face of it, this is suspicious: why is `dhcpagent` opening the file "`/etc/default/dhcpagent`" with such frequency? Hasn't whoever wrote this code ever heard of [`stat`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/816-5167/6mbb2jaj4?a=view)?[^1] To answer the former question, we're going to change our enabling to aggregate on `dhcpagent`'s stack backtrace when it performs an `open`. This is done with the [`ustack`](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlir?a=view) action. The new enabling:

```
# dtrace -n syscall::open:entry'/execname == "dhcpagent"/{@[ustack()] = count()}'
dtrace: description 'syscall::open:entry' matched 1 probe

```

Running the above for ten seconds or so and then `^C`'ing yields the following:

```
^C


              libc.so.1`__open+0xc
              libc.so.1`_endopen+0x92
              libc.so.1`fopen+0x26
              libcmd.so.1`defopen+0x40
              dhcpagent`df_get_string+0x27
              dhcpagent`df_get_int+0x1c
              dhcpagent`dhcp_requesting+0x248
              libinetutil.so.1`iu_expire_timers+0x8a
              libinetutil.so.1`iu_handle_events+0x95
              dhcpagent`main+0x300
              805314a
                4

```

This tells us that all four of the `open` calls were from the above stack trace.

From here we have many options, and our course of action would depend on how we wanted to investigate this. Up until this point, we have been instrumenting only the system call layer -- the shim layer between applications and the kernel. We may wish to now instrument the application itself. To do this, we first need to know how many `dhcpagent` processes are contributing to the output we're seeing above. There are lots of ways to do this; a simple way is to aggregate on `pid`:

```
# dtrace -n syscall:::entry'/execname == "dhcpagent"/{@[pid] = count()}'
dtrace: description 'syscall:::entry' matched 226 probes
^C

       43               80

```

This indicates that in the time between when we started the above, and the time that we `^C`'d, we saw 80 system calls from pid 43 -- and that is was the only `dhcpagent` process that made any system calls. Now that we have the pid that we're intrested in, we can instrument the application. For starters, let's just instrument the `defopen` function in `libcmd.so.1`. (We know that it's being called because we saw it in the stack backtrace of the `open` system call.) To do this:

```
# dtrace -n pid43::defopen:entry
dtrace: description 'pid43::defopen:entry' matched 1 probe
CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
^C

```

With this we have instrumented the _running app_. When we `^C`'d, the app went back to being its usual optimized self. (Or at least, as optimized as `dhcpagent` ever is.)

If we wanted to trace both entry to and return from the `defopen` function, we could add another enabling to the mix:

```
# dtrace -n pid43::defopen:entry,pid43::defopen:return
dtrace: description 'pid43::defopen:entry,pid43::defopen:return' matched 2 probes
CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32623                   defopen:return
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32623                   defopen:return
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32623                   defopen:return
  0  32622                    defopen:entry
  0  32623                   defopen:return
^C

```

But we may want to know more than this: we may want to know _everything called_ from `defopen`. Answering this is a bit more sophisticated -- and it's a little too much for the command line. To answer this question, we head to an editor and type in the following [DTrace script](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlkk?a=view):

```
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -s

pid43::defopen:entry
{
        self->follow = 1;
}

pid43:::entry,
pid43:::return
/self->follow/
{}

pid43::defopen:return
/self->follow/
{
        self->follow = 0;
        exit(0);
}

```

So what is this script doing? We're enabling `defopen` again, but this time we're setting a [thread-local variable](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidlft?a=view) -- which we named "`follow`" to 1. We then enabled _every_ function entry and return in the process, with the predicate that we're only interested if our thread-local variable is non-zero. This has the effect of only tracing function entry and return if the function call was induced by `defopen`. We're only interested in capturing one of these traces, which is the reason why we explicitly [exit](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6223/6mlkidliv?a=view) in the `pid43::defopen:return` clause.

Running the above is going to instrument the hell out of `dhcpagent`. We're going to see that we matched many, many probes. Then we'll see a bunch of output as `defopen` is called. Finally, we'll be dropped back onto the shell prompt as we hit the `exit` action. By the time we see the shell again, we have restored the `dhcpagent` process to its uninstrumented self. Running the above, assuming it's in `dhcp.d`:

```

This is interesting, but a little hard to sift through. Go back to `dhcp.d`, and add the following line:

```
#pragma D option flowindent

```

This sets a simple option that indents a code flow: probes named `entry` cause indentation to increase two spaces, and probes named `return` cause indentation to decrease two spaces. Running the new `dhcp.d`:

```

Now it's much easier to see what exactly is going on. One thing I may be interested in doing is tracing a timestamp at each of these points -- to get an idea of how much time we're spending in each of these functions. To do this, copy `dhcp.d` to `dhcptime.d`, and modify it to look like this:

```
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -s

#pragma D option flowindent

pid43::defopen:entry
{
        self->start = vtimestamp;
}

pid43:::entry,
pid43:::return
/self->start/
{
        trace(vtimestamp - self->start);
}

pid43::defopen:return
/self->start/
{
        self->start = 0;
        exit(0);
}

```

Running `dhcptime.d`:

The times in the above are all in nanoseconds. That is, the call to `_get_thr_data` was 2,276 nanoseconds after we called `defopen`, the first call to `thr_getspecific` was 6,214 nanoseconds, and so on. Note the big jump in `__open` above: we spent over sixty microseconds (334,013 - 271,268 > 60,000) in that one function. What happened there? We went into the kernel of course. (Remember, we found `defopen` by aggregating on the user stack from the `open` system call.) We may wish to know _everything_ -- kernel _and_ user -- that happens from `defopen`. To do this, go back to the original `dhcp.d` and change this:

```
pid43:::entry,
pid43:::return
/self->follow/
{}

```

To this:

```
pid43:::entry,
pid43:::return,
fbt:::
/self->follow/
{
        printf("  (%s)", probeprov);
}

```

The "`fbt:::`" line enables _every_ probe from the `fbt` provider. Recall that this provider makes available a probe upon entry to and return from every function in the kernel. I've added an additional line that records the name of the current provider (the "`probeprov`" variable) to make clear if a probe is in the kernel or is in user-space. This script is really going to instrument the snot out of the system; running the new `dhcp.d`:

```
# ./dhcp.d

As the transition from `pid43` to `fbt` in the above indicates, this script shows us flow control _across_ the user/kernel boundary. (At the risk of sounding too much like [Ron Popeil](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/08/dtrace_user_take/), the above output is the clearest display of code flow across a protection boundary from _any_ tool -- research or otherwise.)

By this point in the demo, the audience is usually convinced that DTrace can instrument huge tracts of the system that were never before observable; the focus usually shifts from "can this do anything?" to "can this do anything for **me**?" The short answer is "yes" (of course), but a longer answer is merited. Unfortunately, this blog entry has already gone on long enough however; I'll save the longer answer for another day...

[^1]: For whatever it's worth, a bug has been filed on this issue. Once it's fixed, I will sadly have to find some other sub-optimal software with which to demonstrate DTrace. The good news is that such software isn't terribly [hard to find](http://openoffice.org).
