Finally, we have the [South Park](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/southpark/ultimatefangame/index.jhtml?_requestid=63173) of operating systems: [Inside Jack](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/insidejack2/). It's really pretty funny -- and it even offers a rare glimpse (albeit animated) at Mike, the shadowy and elusive third member of [Team DTrace](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/meet_architects.html#dtrace). And if you enjoyed [that episode](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/insidejack2/) of Inside Jack, there's [an earlier episode](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/insidejack1/index.html) that's also pretty amusing.
