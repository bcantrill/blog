For those of you in the Bay Area, I will be giving a talk and demo on [DTrace](http://bigadmin.com/content/dtrace) at tonight's [BayLISA](http://www.baylisa.org/) meeting in Cupertino. Starts at 7:30p, here are the [directions](http://www.baylisa.org/locations/). I will be demo'ing DTrace tonight on my laptop running [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org) bits that I downloaded and built myself from outside of Sun's internal network. So if you're interested in DTrace, OpenSolaris or both (and you're in the Bay Area), you might want to check it out...
