On a Sunday night not too long ago, something extraordinary happened in West
Oakland: the Oakland Ballers -- an independent baseball team not even two
years old -- won the Pioneer League championship, bringing a baseball
championship to Oakland for the first time since 1989.  The atmosphere was
electric, but to an outsider, the roar of the packed house might have seemed
perplexing:  why such fervor for...  an independent league baseball game?!
The beauty of baseball is the narrative beyond the diamond, and that Sunday
night in Oakland stands as an exemplar.  Speaking personally, to understand
not just why I was there with my wife and our teenage daughter, but the
emotion behind our full-throated chants, you need to go back in time, to a
little more than a decade ago.

It was 2014.  After a promising season, the Oakland A's had just had an early
exit from the playoffs, having lost a gutting extra innings single-game
wildcard in Kansas City. Our boys -- then aged seven and ten -- had had their
hearts broken, in a way that a sports team uniquely can for kids of a certain
age.  The boys were weeping; we consoled them as parents of grieving sports
fans do -- not by saying that "it's just a game" (an obvious lie!), but by
saying what parents have said for generations: wait until next year.
"Someday," I recall telling them as they went to bed, "perhaps decades from
now, the A's will be in the World Series in Oakland -- and we will be there to
watch it together." Tears dried, the boys went to sleep; there was, after all,
always next year.

Fast forward a decade, to 2023, and I was being proven a liar -- not by
disappointment on the field, but by treachery off it: the owner of the Oakland
A's -- link:/2025/06/29/the-end-game-for-john-fisher/[titanic failson John
Fisher] -- had won approval to move the team from Oakland; after years
of threats, the A's were actually leaving.  As
https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/06/15/athletics-las-vegas-brodie-brazil-emotional-video-fan-reaction/81060866007/[Brodie
cried], so did we all.  This emotion may seem confusing: is this grieving
over... one less entertainment option?  Well, no, it's about more than the
team or even the game -- it's about who we have watched those games *with*.
It's not just our fellow fans; it's our friends -- our families.  In our
house, it was our nuclear family:  we had become A's fans in 2012 when our
oldest caught the baseball bug at seven (aside:

has it]).  For other A's fans, it was multi-generational; listen to

it when he https://www.tiktok.com/@cbssports/video/7244391382079573290[was
interviewed at the Reverse Boycott at the Coliseum]:

My dad didn't know what to do with me, so he brought me here and we used to 
walk across that BART bridge to games, and it was like magic. I watched
Dwayne Murphy and Ricky Henderson out there running the outfield, stealing
bases, hats flying off, it was beautiful. And that's what made me fall in love
with baseball.

And then I had a little brother who is 13 years younger than
me, and I didn't know what to do with him. So what did I do? I brought him here.
I brought him to baseball games, I brought him to Opening Day. His birthday is
in April, and we would come to Opening Day every year. And when I went away
to college, I would send him tickets to Opening Day every year. And he
would call me for the national anthem, and he would call me for the 
seventh-inning stretch, and he would call me for Jason Giambi's first
at bat as a Yankee, so I could hear the boos.

And then when I had kids,
I knew what to do with them.  And so what did I do?  I brought them
here. My kids are so at home here, they come in here and they take
off their jackets and they drop them in a corner and they run off because
they feel like they're at home.  That's what baseball in Oakland is. This
is generations.

To rip a team out of a city, then, is to sour some of our dearest memories,
ones that cannot be recreated; it is to come into a home and desecrate the
family photo album.  And the scar is permanent: look at the Sonics or the
North Stars or the Expos or the Nordiques -- to say nothing of the generation-defining trauma
of the Colts or the Dodgers.  For each of these -- the most recent of which
was nearly two decades ago -- you won't have to look long to find people who
got passed it, but never, in fact, got over it.

And this is where I was when 2024 rolled around:  passed it, maybe, but
link:/2023/11/18/is-it-worse-for-john-fisher/[absolutely not over it].

And then, in March, a surprise.  From the arsonous ashes of Oakland baseball
emerged an unexpected green shoot:  a new independent league team, the Oakland
Ballers.  In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBEVebVcO4[the video announcing
the team], the words of
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistah_F.A.B.[Mistah F.A.B.]
echoed: "Anytime something ends, something else begins." I was elated
at the prospect of the Ballers -- and then doubly so when
https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/a-baseball-startup-with-paul-freedman-and-bryan-carmel[team
co-founders Paul Freedman and Bryan Carmel joined us on _Oxide and Friends_].
Somehow, in the span of just a few frenetic weeks in the spring of 2024, they
turned
https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/oakland-ballers-honor-a-baseball-legacy-with-new-raimondi-park-facilities/[historic
Raimondi Park] into a proper ballpark.  The home opener in 2024 was sold out
and while (per grand tradition of Oakland baseball!) the home team lost,
https://sfstandard.com/2024/06/04/oakland-ballers-home-opener-raimondi-par/[the
game was a blast].

As the 2024 season went on, the games felt like a neighborhood block party --
you always saw people you knew.  And the team knew their town: when they
unveiled their new mascot, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY7KBMLDGK8[Scrappy
the Possum], it was a pitch-perfect
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gritty[Gritty-esque] reflection of the
Oakland zeitgeist.  The team made the playoffs that year, winning a game at home but
losing in the semi-finals.  I was at the game with the kids -- and as my
then-17-year-old said, "it's great to have postseason baseball back in
Oakland." And it was!  

Then, the 2025 season -- this season.  Early in the season, there was a
discernible shift.  Something to know about the Pioneer League is that it's
professional, but it's deliberately a development league:  players can't have
more than three years of professional experience.  And with the MLB draft
having been drastically cut (from 40 rounds to 20), MLB-affiliated development
leagues like the Pioneer League are increasingly where young players go to try
to chase their dream of making it to the bigs.  The Ballers were making a name for
themselves among college players from the region -- and
https://oaklandside.org/2025/07/31/oakland-ballers-pioneer-league-baseball-local-players/[the
complexion of the roster was changing], with increasingly familiar names.
These were kids who had grown up in Berkeley and Martinez and Hayward and
Stockton -- who had gone to JUCO at Chabot and Ohlone, to college at East Bay
and Davis and Cal and St. Mary's.  These were... NorCal kids.  Our kids.  And
they were good.  Like, really good.

The structure of the postseaon in the Pioneer League is that the season is
divided into two halves, with the top two teams of each half making the
playoffs.  This makes it exciting for the players and the fans:  no matter how
rocky a start a team has, they could still make the postseason with a strong
second-half showing.  But the Ballers had different plans:  they won both the
first half _and_ the second half, becoming
https://www.oaklandballers.com/sports/bsb/2025/releases/202509034ethcv[the
winningest team in Pioneer League history].

All of this winning meant that the Ballers secured their postseason fate
remarkably early in the season, which presented us at Oxide with a wild
opportunity:  as we were planning our annual internal meetup (which we call
OxCon), we were realizing that the last night of the meetup was going to fall
on the first postseason game at home.  We felt we had to take the Oxide team to see
the Ballers, and it's a credit to our idiosyncratic team at Oxide that they
embraced the idiosyncratic one at Raimondi.  My colleague iliana -- a Mariners
fan! -- felt that we should explain baseball to our fellow nerds, and the
final session of OxCon was the two of us explaining what people were about to
see.  (Or tried to, anyway -- baseball defies quick explanation!)   We piled
into busses and headed over to Raimondi, with kids and partners who were local
meeting us at the game.  We knew that we had kept our Oxide colleagues (very)
busy over the week of OxCon, and told them that they should buy Ballers gear
on Oxide's nickel for anyone back home who might appreciate it.  The
https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social/post/3lymmhpuoek2s[game was
awesome]: the Ballers won -- and Oxide employees went home loaded with swag
for their families.

For the Ballers, their season continued.  The three-game series went to the
win-or-go-home third game, and after a gripping 1-0 victory, the Ballers
advanced to the championship against the Idaho Falls Chukars.  The five game
set had a familiar format:  two games away followed by three at home.  The
Ballers lost their first two games in Idaho Falls -- badly.  With the
championship and the season on the line, the team returned to Oakland, where
they needed to win three straight, starting on Friday night.  My daughter was
stoked:  "Can you imagine the atmosphere on Sunday?" she excitedly asked.  I
pointed out that the team was going to be lucky to get the chance to play
Saturday, let alone Sunday.

But my daughter's optimisim proved to be prophetic.  The team won decisively
on Friday night -- and again on Saturday night.  And the atmosphere was indeed
singular on the sold-out Sunday night.  The Ballers got a good start with an
early 3-run homerun -- and then blew the game open with another 3-run jack to
deep center in the 8th.  Going into the top of the 9th inning, the Ballers
were up by 8 runs.  Any baseball fan will tell you that one bad inning can
sink a game, that there is no lead large enough to assure a victory.  Still,
this felt pretty good.

The boys are away at college now, but they were with us in spirit, and my
18-year-old was listening from college in Washington.  With two outs, he
texted me: "Film this last out." I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbK5N5LfIGk[filmed it]: a swinging strikeout
as the stadium erupted.  Oakland Fire, which would often position a fire
engine in the outfield and sit atop it to watch the game, turned on their
lights in celebration.  The team stormed out of the dugout and mobbed their
pitcher.  And then, magic:  that fire engine in deep center pointed a stream
of water skyward and onto the outfield.  The players instinctively ran to the
water, like kids running through a sprinkler.  They slid in the outfield,
making snow angels on the wet ground.  It was everything great about sports,
in a single joyous moment.

These players know the significance of it all:  they -- like Oakland -- have
something to prove.  The Pioneer League is a development league, so while we
see some returning players next year, many will also move on.  Some will move
to other independent leagues, chasing their major league dream.  Others will
presumably hang it up, just as everyone hangs it up eventually.  But for all
of them, wherever their careers may take them, they will forever remember that
electric Sunday night in West Oakland, when they proved what is possible when
we refuse to give up on ourselves.

At long last, there's
