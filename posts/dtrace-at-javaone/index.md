I spent the day today at [JavaOne](http://java.sun.com/javaone/) in the City, where [DTrace](http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) was featured prominently in the morning keynote: [JohnnyL](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/johnnyl) described DTrace in the abstract, and drew a (surprisingly large!) round of applause when he announced that [DTrace now supports Java](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=your_java_fell_into_my). He then called [Adam](http://blogs.sun.com/ahl) on stage to do a demo, the most remarkable aspect of which is that it was _actually_ DTrace and not the canned, gussied-up gimcrack that normally passes for a keynote demo. In fact, this demo was so tangibly real, Adam has [blogged the scripts from the demo](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/ahl?entry=open_sourcing_the_javaone_keynote). With these scripts, you can now give Adam's keynote in the comfort of your own home!

In other JavaOne news, Adam, [Stephen](http://blogs.sun.com/sch) and I are going to be leading the charge at an [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org) BOF tonight at 7:30pm at the San Francisco Marriot in Golden Gate B1. With the [IBM announcement today](http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/200506/sunflash.20050627.3.html) supporting Solaris, with the new [super-fast, super-cheap Solaris Opteron workstation](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/freeopteronworkstation/index.html), and with new Solaris technologies like DTrace and [Zones](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zones/), Solaris has never been more attractive to the Java developer; swing by our BOF to see what all the fuss is about!
