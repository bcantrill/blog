Adam Leventhal, Mike Shapiro and I will be on-line tomorrow (Wednesday) at 10a Pacific for an [Expert Exchange](http://see.sun.com/Apps/DCS/mcp?q=ST1EW99TFb8i2LZ) on DTrace. This is your opportunity to have your questions answered on-line by the people who wrote the code. (Which is to say, us.) Hope to see you (virtually) tomorrow!
