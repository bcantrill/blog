I ran across a fantastic [DTrace blog](http://solaris.reys.net/categories/3-DTrace). The only problem: it's in Russian. (Or rather, it's in Cyrillic -- I suppose it could be any one of [several dozen languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic#Languages_using_Cyrillic), but it seems unlikely that it's in [Mansi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansi) or [Yakut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakut_language).) Even if you only understand the examples, it's worth checking out -- and perhaps I can convince [Andrei](http://blogs.sun.com/andrei) to translate the juicy bits...
