About three months ago, I wrote about the [exciting possibilities of combining Debian and OpenSolaris](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc?entry=ubuntu_and_dtrace_break_bread). To be honest, when I wrote that I assumed that such a [Xanadu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu) would be a couple of years off at least -- combining these systems is non-trivial. You can thus imagine my surprise last week when I first heard of the [Nexenta project](http://gnusolaris.org). If you haven't heard, this project is doing _exactly_ what [Jeff](http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/blog/), [Adam](http://blogs.sun.com/ahl), [Mike](http://blogs.sun.com/mws) and I were wishing for: [Debian package management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) on an [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org/os) kernel. Of course, hearing about a new technology is one thing; seeing it is quite another -- I wanted to get my hands on actual bits before I got too excited. Well, today Nexenta released [their ISOs](http://www.genunix.org/distributions/gnusolaris/). And, to make a pleasantly short story even shorter, I am writing this now running Nexenta on my Acer Ferrari 3400. But don't take my word for it; check out this [screenshot](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/bmc/Nexenta.png) -- and note in particular my use of [DTrace](http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace) to examine the package management system. Oh be still, my beating heart!
