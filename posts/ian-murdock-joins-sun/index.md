I know that I've been quiet for a while, and I promise that I (or rather, [we](http://www.flickr.com/photos/66572791@N00/18206393/)) are close to talking about what we've been up to for the past year, but I wanted to first pop my head up to to highlight out some exciting news: [Ian Murdock has joined Sun](http://ianmurdock.com/2007/03/19/joining sun/).

I have always been impressed with Ian's decidedly pragmatic views of technology; he has been [a supporter of OpenSolaris](http://ianmurdock.com/?p=242), and in particular he took [a decisive and courageous stand](http://ianmurdock.com/?p=278) against [some absurd Debian-borne anti-Nexenta licensing FUD](http://lwn.net/Articles/159248/). Looking back, it's hard to imagine that our [was not even two years ago, and that it was just eighteen months ago that we first saw](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/ubuntu_and_dtrace_break_bread) [a prototype of what that Utopia might look like](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/your_debian_fell_into_my). Ian's arrival at Sun is a huge lurch forward towards the wide-spread productization of this ideal: it's great news for OpenSolaris and it's great news for long-time fans of Debian -- it looks like we're going to be able to apt-get our cake, and DTrace it too!
