It normally doesn't -- and it probably shouldn't. But Chris Preimesberger, the author of [the story on Solaris 10](http://servers.itmanagersjournal.com/servers/04/06/17/2019258.shtml) that [I mentioned on Friday](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bmc/20040618#be_careful_what_you_ask), has apparently read (and commented on) my blog entry -- and he corrected the story! The details of the paragraph are now correct, and I'm certainly happier.  
  
This whole episode has given me insight into the unique tribulations of being a technical reporter. It must take a thick skin to be dealing with people like me all of the time: fast talkers who bombard with technical detail, and then expect absolute accuracy in whatever stories emerge. Of course, from my perspective, the problem is that the readership assumes absolute accuracy -- and if the technical details are incorrect, they will naturally blame the technology (or worse, the technologist) instead of questioning the accuracy of the reportage.  
  
Anyway, Chris: thanks for correcting the story; it's much appreciated.
