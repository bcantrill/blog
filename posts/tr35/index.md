So MIT's [Technology Review](http://www.techreview.com/) has named me as one of their [TR35](http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/10/issue/feature_tr35.asp) -- the top 35 innovators under the age of thirty five. It's a great honor, especially because the other honorees are _actually_ working on things like [cures for cancer](http://www.wi.mit.edu/research/fellows/brummelkamp.html) and [rocket science](http://www.pw.utc.com/shock-system/popsci.html) -- domains that I have known only as rhetorical flourish. Should you like to hear me make a jackass out of myself on the subject, you might want to check out [Richard Giles](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/rgiles)'s [latest I/O podcast](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/rgiles?entry=i_o_podcast_0003_bryan), in which he interviewed me about the award.
