Approving this RTI makes me feel like John Hancock signing the Declaration of
Independence; I just hope my e-mail address is sufficiently large that King
Stein can read it without his spectacles!
 
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all processes are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Parent Process with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Signals, and the pursuit of Performance. -- That to
secure these rights, Threads Libraries are instituted among Programs, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the processes, -- That whenever any Form
of Threads Library becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the
Gatelings to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Threads Library,
laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its data structures in
Reliability."

This RTI is hereby approved; long live the one and true libthread!
