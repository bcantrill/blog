Back when Solaris was initially open sourced, there was a conscious effort to be mindful of the experiences of other projects. In particular -- even though it was somewhat of a paradox -- it was understood how important it was for the community to have the power to fork the operating system. As [I wrote in January, 2005](http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/opensolaris-discuss/2005-January/001500.html):

> If there's one thing we've learned from watching Linux, it's to not become forkophobic. Paradoxically, in an environment where forks are actively encouraged (e.g. Linux) forking seems to be less of a problem than in environments where forking is viewed as apostasy (e.g. BSD).

Unfortunately -- and now in hindsight -- we know that OpenSolaris didn't go far enough: even though the _right_ to fork was understood, there was not enough attention paid to the _power_ to fork. As a result, the operating system never _quite_ got to being 100% open: there remained some annoying (but essential) little bits that could not be opened for one historical (i.e., legal) reason or another. When coupled with the fact that Sun historically had a monopoly or near-monopoly on Solaris engineering talent, the community was entirely deprived of the oxygen that it would have needed to exercise its right to fork.

But change is afoot: over the last six months, the monopoly over Solaris engineering talent [has](http://blogs.sun.com/sch/entry/penultimate) [been](http://sunaytripathi.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/its-not-a-goodbye-leaving-oracle-but-not-solaris/) [broken](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2010/07/25/good-bye-sun/). And now today, we as a community have turned an important corner with the [announcement](http://www.illumos.org/attachments/download/3/illumos.pdf) of the [Illumos project](http://illumos.org/). Thanks to the hard work of [Garrett D'Amore](http://gdamore.blogspot.com/) and his band of co-conspirators, we have the beginning of open sourced variants of those final bits that will allow for not just the right but the _power_ to fork. Not that anyone wants to set out to fork the system, of course, but that power is absolutely essential for the vitality of any open source community -- and so will be for ours. Kudos to Garrett and crew; on behalf of all of us in the community, thank you!
