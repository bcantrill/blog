DTrace has landed.  Twenty-three months after we set out, the first cut
of DTrace has integrated into Solaris 10.

Many of you have helped DTrace enormously -- you have used it, advocated it,
found problems with it, and suggested direction for it.  With DTrace, we
sought very much to build the tool that we always wished we had; thanks to
your guidance and encouragement, we have executed on that original vision --
and much beyond.  We are grateful; your engagement in DTrace has helped make
it what it is today.

There are several people who we want to recognize for having exerted 
extraordinary effort to help DTrace:

- Bart Smaalders has been a strong advocate of DTrace from its inception, and
  a sounding board for many ideas that found their way into DTrace.  Bart's
  pitching of DTrace in front of both Sun employees and Sun customers has
  been an inspiration -- not to mention an enormous help.

- Gavin Maltby put together a fantastic online guide to using DTrace -- at a
  time in which there was only the release notes, a terse usage guide, and a
  handful of recipes.  When we went to write the documentation, we found
  ourselves constantly referring back to this guide to see how Gavin had
  explained something.  

- Jon Haslam found an enormous number of bugs, especially in the early days of
  DTrace on x86.  We were amazed that Jon could run into so many problems, and
  still be such a tireless advocate for DTrace.  In particular, Jon wrote a
  great piece on DTrace for the "Technocrat" SE publication.

- Jonathan Adams performed a tremendous amount of ongoing review of the DTrace
  source code.  Jonathan asked to be put on our putback notification when it
  was decided that his project (Greenline) was to be a child of the DTrace
  gate -- and he seems to have looked at the diffs for every putback.  
  Jonathan also ended up with the impossible task of reviewing the 11,000+
  lines in the in-kernel DTrace infrastructure.  His review was thorough, and
  he found several issues; it is much appreciated.

- Jarod Jenson of Aeysis Inc. has the distinction of being the first (and as
  of right now, only) customer to use DTrace.  Jarod has diligently taken the
  archives that we have sent them, and beaten the snot out of them.  DTrace
  was designed for Jarod in mind; it has been singularly rewarding that he has
  found DTrace to be useful.

- Bill Moore -- though only rejoining Sun several months ago -- has become one
  of DTrace's strongest advocates in that short time.  Bill used DTrace
  with enormous success on the ZFS project -- where data gathered with DTrace
  has helped him achieve some galactic wins on ZFS performance.  We have been 
  elated to see such a confluence between ZFS and DTrace!
  
Finally, a random index that we have compiled about the DTrace project:
