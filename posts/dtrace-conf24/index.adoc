Sometime in late 2007, we had the idea of a DTrace conference. 
Or really, more of a meetup; from the primordial e-mail I sent:

____
The goal here, by the way, is not a DTrace user group, but more of a
face-to-face meeting with people actively involved in DTrace -- either by
porting it to another system, by integrating probes into higher level
environments, by building higher-level tools on top of DTrace or by using it
heavily and/or in a critical role.  That said, we also don't want to be
exclusionary, so our thinking is that the only true requirement for attending
is that everyone must be prepared to speak informally for 15 mins or so on
what they are doing with DTrace, any limitations that they have encountered,
and some ideas for the future.  We're thinking that this is going to be on
the order of 15-30 people (though more would be a good problem to have --
we'll track it if necessary), that it will be one full day (breakfast in the
morning through drinks into the evening), and that we're going to host it
here at our offices in San Francisco sometime in March 2008.  
____

This same note also included some suggested names for the gathering,
including what in hindsight seems a clear winner:
link:images/bi-mon-sci-fi-con.gif[DTrace Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con].
As if knowing that I should leave an explanatory note to my future self as to
why this name was not selected, my past self 
fortunately clarified:
"before everyone clamors for the obvious Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con, you should know
that most Millennials don't (sadly) get the reference."  (While I disagree
with the judgement of my past self, it at least indicates that at some
point I cared if anyone got the reference.)

We settled on a https://illumos.org/books/dtrace/chp-anon.html#chp-anon[much more obscure reference],
and had https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2008/03/16/dtrace.conf08/[the first dtrace.conf in March 2008].
Befitting the style of the time, it was an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference[unconference] (a term that may well have hit its apogee in 2008) that
you signed up to attend by
link:images/wiki.jpg[editing a wiki].
More surprising given the year (and thanks entirely to attendee Ben Rockwood),
it was recorded --
though this is so long ago that 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ4Z22AGj5s#t=38s[I referred to it as video taping]
(and with none of the participants mic'd, I'm afraid the quality isn't very good).
The conference, however, was terrific, viz. the reports of 
https://ahl.dtrace.org/2008/05/05/dtrace-conf-post-post-mortem/[Adam],
https://x86vmm.blogspot.com/2008/03/dtraceconf08.html[Keith] and
https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2008/03/16/dtraceconf-and-the-dumbest-guy-in-the-room/[Stephen] (all somehow still online nearly two decades later).
If anything, it was a little _too_ good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PU0WkMJNGU#t=4m0s[we realized that we couldn't recreate the magic], and we
demurred on making it an annual event.

Years passed, and memories faded.  By 2012, it felt like we wanted to get
folks together again, now under a post-lawnmower corporate aegis in Joyent.
The resulting
https://ahl.dtrace.org/2012/04/09/dtrace-conf12-wrap-up/[dtrace.conf(12)] was
a success, and
the Olympiad cadence felt like the right one; we did it again four years
later at
https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2016/07/29/dtrace-conf16-wrap-up/[dtrace.conf(16)].

In 2020, we came back together for
https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2019/12/02/the-soul-of-a-new-computer-company/[a
new adventure] -- and the DTrace Olympiad was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeUFzBBRilM#t=1h30m36s[not lost on Adam].
Alas, dtrace.conf(20) -- like the Olympics themselves -- was cancelled, if
implicitly.
Unlike the Olympics, however, it was not to be rescheduled.

More years passed and DTrace continued to prove its utility at Oxide;
last year when Adam and I did our 
https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/dtrace-at-20["DTrace at 20" episode of
_Oxide and Friends_],
we vowed to hold dtrace.conf(24) -- and a few months ago, we set our date to be December 11th.

At first we assumed we would do something similar to our earlier conferences:
a one-day participant-run conference, at the Oxide office in Emeryville.
But times have changed: thanks to 
https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/the-future-of-work-2022-03-07[the
rise of remote work], technologists are
much more dispersed -- and many more people would need to travel for
dtrace.conf(24) than in previous DTrace Olympiads.
Travel hasn't become any cheaper since 2008, and the cost (and inconvenience) was 
clearly going to limit attendance.

The dilemma for our small meetup
 highlights the
changing dynamics in tech conferences in general: with talks all recorded and made
publicly available after the conference, how does one justify attending
a conference in person?
There can be reasonable answers to that question, of course:  it may be the hallway
track, or the expo hall, or the after-hours socializing, or perhaps some
other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHeqakyWQT0[special conference experience].
But it's also not surprising that some conferences -- especially ones
really focused on technical content -- have decided that they are better
off doing as 
https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/[conference giant O'Reilly Media did], and
going exclusively online.
And without the need to feed and shelter participants, the
logistics for running a conference become much more tenable -- and the
price point can be lowered to the point that even highly produced
conferences like 
https://www.p99conf.io/[P99 CONF] 
can be made freely available.
This, in turn, leads to much greater attendance -- and a network effect that
can get back some of what one might lose going online.  In particular, 
using chat as the hallway track can be more much effective (and is
certainly more scalable!) than the *actual* physical hallways at a conference.

For conferences in general, there is a conversation to be had here
(and as a teaser,
Adam and I are going to
https://discord.gg/QrcKGTTPrF?event=1313157996645322784[talk about it with
Stephen O'Grady and Theo Schlossnagle on _Oxide and Friends_ next week], but
for our quirky, one-day, Olympiad-cadence dtrace.conf, the decision was
pretty easy:  there was much more to be gained than lost by going 
exclusively on-line.

So dtrace.conf(24) is coming up next week, and
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dtraceconf24-tickets-1044402936297?aff=oddtdtcreator[it's available to everyone].
In terms of platform, we're going to try to keep that pretty simple:
we're going to use Google Meet for the actual presenters, which we will
stream in real-time to YouTube -- and we'll use
https://discord.gg/QrcKGTTPrF?event=1313617352541208747[the Oxide Discord]
for all chat.
We're hoping you'll join us on December 11th -- and if you want to talk
about DTrace or a DTrace-adjacent topic, we'd love for you to present!
Keeping to the
unconference style, if you would like to present, please indicate your
topic in
https://discord.gg/tTECbxDf88[the #session-topics Discord channel] so
we can get the agenda fleshed out.

While we're excited to be online, there *are* some historical
accoutrements of conferences
that we didn't want to give up.
First, we have a tradition of t-shirts with dtrace.conf.
Thanks to our designer
https://bsky.app/profile/benleonard.bsky.social[Ben Leonard], we have
link:images/dtrace-conf24-shirt.png[a banger of a t-shirt],
capturing the spirit of our original dtrace.conf(08) shirt but
with an Oxide twist.
It's (obviously) harder to make those free but we have tried to
price them reasonably.  You can get your t-shirt by adding it to your
(free) 
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dtraceconf24-tickets-1044402936297?aff=oddtdtcreator[dtrace.conf ticket].
(And for those who present at dtrace.conf, your shirt is on us -- we'll send
you a coupon code!)

Second, for those who can make their way to the East Bay and
want some hangout time, we are
going to have an apr√®s conference social event at the Oxide office starting
at 5p.  We're charging something nominal for that too
(and like the t-shirt, you pay for that via your
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dtraceconf24-tickets-1044402936297?aff=oddtdtcreator[dtrace.conf ticket]);
we'll have
some food and drinks and an Oxide hardware tour for the curious -- and
(of course?) there will be https://github.com/fishpong/docs/wiki/Primer[Fishpong].

Much has changed since I sent that e-mail 17 years ago -- but the shared
values and disposition that brought together our small community continue
to endure; we look forward to seeing everyone (virtually) at dtrace.conf(24)!
