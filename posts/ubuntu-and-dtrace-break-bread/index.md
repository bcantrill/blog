Today, [Mike](http://blogs.sun.com/mws), [Adam](http://blogs.sun.com/ahl) and I had lunch with [Jeff Waugh](http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/blog/), who is in town for LinuxWorld. He showed us his, we showed him ours, and a great time was had by all. I think everyone agreed that a system with [Debian packages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool), [Ubuntu package management](http://gnomejournal.org/article/19/simplified-package-management-in-ubuntu-hoary), the [Solaris Service Management Facility](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/smf-quickstart.html) and (of course) [DTrace](http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/) would be one **hell** of a system. And with [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org), this paradise seems tantalizingly attainable -- or does [original sin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin) prevent us from reentering [the garden](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/bosch/delight/delightc.jpg)?
