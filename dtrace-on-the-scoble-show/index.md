For those who didn't see it, [Team DTrace was on the Scoble Show](http://scobleizer.com/2007/07/03/a-conversation-with-suns-dtrace-team). As I mention at the end of the interview, this was the day after [my younger son](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/alexander_morgan_gaffikin_cantrill) was born (if you look closely at my right wrist, you will note that I am still wearing my hospital bracelet in the interview). You can see the cigars that I offered at the end of the interview (and they were [damn fine cigars](http://www.cigarworld.com/brands/macanudo/macanudo_index.cfm), by the way) in [a photo of Team DTrace](http://www.flickr.com/photos/35034363287@N01/566408503/) that Scoble took afterwards. After the photo, we returned to our office and smoked the cigars -- and then had an unplanned conversation with the building management about never again smoking cigars in the office. (I responded that I was done having kids, so they had nothing to worry about.)

Finally, as for DTrace on the iPhone (to which we made brief reference in the interview): it is now our understanding that alas, DTrace is not on the iPhone -- Apple has apparently not yet ported DTrace to the ARM -- but that a DTrace port "may be" in the works. So the dream is alive!
