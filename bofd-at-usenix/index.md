Just got back from the Solaris BOF here at [USENIX '04](http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix04/) -- it was great to see so many people there! Hopefully it was useful to you; at the very least, you learned about [a beautiful piece of Solaris documentation](http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-1984?q=linker+&s=t) -- not to mention how I feel about [compiler folks](http://www.dmv.ca.gov/). You shouldn't have any trouble finding more information on [DTrace](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace), [Zones](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/zones), or [Predictive self-healing](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal); information on ZFS and the service management facility will be available after they become publicly available (which should be quite soon). Thanks for coming tonight -- and thanks for all of the kind words tonight about the technology in [Solaris 10](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/10/) in general, and about DTrace in particular. It's tremendously rewarding for us to see you so excited about these technologies!
