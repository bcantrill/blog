In general, I don't believe in drawing attention to bugs in the software of others: any significant body of software is likely to have bugs, and I think one can too easily draw overly broad inferences by looking at software through the lens of its defects (a pathology that [I have previously discussed](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/on_dreaming_in_code) at some length). However -- and as you might imagine from the preamble -- I'm about to make an exception to that gentlemanly rule...

I, along with zillions of others, read [the breathless hype](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/technology/28cool.html?ref=business) about the new would-be Google slayer, [cuil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuil). When a new search engine pops up, my egotistical reflex is to first search for "dtrace", and [the results of searching for "dtrace" on cuil](http://dtrace.org/resources/bmc/cuil_dtrace.png) were very, um, interesting. The search results themselves were fine; more creative were the images that cuil decided to associate with them. If you look at that screenshot, you will be able to find an image of a quilt, a strip mall, what could pass for a program from an [August Wilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson) play, and -- strangest of all -- [a sign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:PIPWelcomeSign.jpg) that reads "Welcome to Palisades Interstate Parkway". I can't say for certain that I've never travelled on the Palisades Interstate Parkway, but with all deference to that 38.25-mile stretch of tarmac, I do believe that I can say that it played no role in DTrace -- or DTrace in it. Indeed, I can say with absolute confidence that searching for "palisades interstate parkway dtrace" will, in short order, yield only this blog entry -- provided, that is, that one doesn't perform said search on cuil... ;)
