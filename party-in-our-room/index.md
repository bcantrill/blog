If you're at OSCON and you're interested in an after-party with -- I'm told -- "premium drinks", swing by the OpenSolaris suite (room 1560 at the Doubletree) from 10pm on. If for nothing else, you'll want to be there in the early morning hours when [Keith](http://blogs.sun.com/wesolows) throws the furniture out the window in a drunken rage against [gcc's SPARC backend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto).
