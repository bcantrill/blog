On Sunday afternoon, I was on the phone with one of my Oxide co-founders, [Steve Tuck](https://twitter.com/sdtuck). He and I were both trying to grapple with the brazen state-sponsored violence that we were witnessing: the murder of George Floyd and the widespread, brutal, and shameless suppression of those who were demonstrating against it.

Specifically, we were struggling with a problem that (bluntly) a lot of white people struggle with: how to say what when. An earlier conversation with Steve had inspired me to publicly say something that I have long believed: that on social media, you should amplify your listening by following voices that you don't otherwise hear. I had [tweeted that out](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1267196514528452608), and Steve and I were talking about it. In particular, Steve was wondering about telling people to see [_13th_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_(film)), a 2016 documentary by [Ava DuVernay](http://www.avaduvernay.com/) that he had found very moving when he had seen it last year. I had taken my kids to see DuVernay's superlative [_Selma_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_(film)) years prior, and I had heard about _13th_ (and I had recalled my wife saying she wanted to watch it), but it was -- like many things -- "in the queue." Steve was emphatic though: "you **need** to watch it."

If I may, an aside: we -- we all, but especially white Americans -- run away from difficult subjects. With our viewing habits in particular, there are things that we know we absolutely should watch that we just... don't. The reasons are often mundane: because the time isn't right; because we're tired; because we want to be uplifted; because we're ashamed. For my wife and me, this was [_Hotel Rwanda_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Rwanda), a Netflix DVD (!) that we had sitting on top of the DVD player for literally years, not having the heart to send it back -- and yet never in the mood to watch it.

Fortunately, _13th_ was not to share _Hotel Rwanda_'s fate: not only is Steve persuasive, it felt especially apropos as my wife and I were looking for ways to talk about the George Floyd murder and subsequent uprising with our kids -- so I got off the phone with Steve, my wife and I got the family together (pretty easy when living in self-isolation!), and we watched it.

I don't know that I've ever seen a documentary as important. More than anything, it is _revealing_: it connects dots that I didn't realize were connected -- and it shows, with a stunning diversity of voices ([Angela Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis) _and_ [Newt Gingrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich)?!), just how deeply racist our criminal justice system is. Not that it isn't also horrifying in its revelations: my kids gasped several times, including learning of the stunning growth in incarceration -- and of the jaw-dropping fraction of inmates that never stood trial for their crime. And there was plenty of horrifying education beyond the figures; I knew a prison/industrial complex was out there, but I never imagined that it could be such a deliberate, pernicious octopus.

I'm not going to spoil any more of it for you; if you haven't already seen it, you need to [watch _13th_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8) -- and you need to watch it **now**.

Actually, I'm going to phrase it even more bluntly: it is just 100 minutes (very deliberately not longer, as it turns out; watch the [excellent conversation between Ava DuVerney and Oprah Winfrey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFAyhgY92P4) for details); you more or less can't leave your home; and America is boiling over on this very issue. So let's put it another way: if you are unwilling to watch this now, be honest with yourself and realize that you are _never_ going to watch it. And if you are never going to watch it, please spare us all the black squares and the trending hashtags: if you do not have 100 minutes to give to this most important topic at this most critical moment, you are not _actually_ willing to do anything at all.

So you need to watch it, but is watching a documentary really the answer? Well, no, of course not -- but that isn't to say film can't change the collective mind: [The Day After](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After) famously informed Ronald Reagan's views on the dangers of nuclear war, at a(nother) time when humanity felt perilously close to the brink. And I _do_ believe that _13th_ could have that kind of power -- so I would ask you to not only watch it, but use your voice (and, for many of you, your privilege) to get others to do the same.

Once you've watched it -- and once you've gotten your friends and family to watch it -- the tough work begins: we need to not merely reform this system, we need to rethink it entirely. And for this, you want to get your resources to the non-profits taking this on (there are a bunch out there; one in particular that I would recommend is [The Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org/)). Thanks to Ava DuVernay for making such a singularly important film -- and thank you in advance for doing her (and us all!) the service of watching it!
