We on [Team DTrace](http://www.flickr.com/photos/35034363287@N01/566408503/) have realized that with so much going on in the world of DTrace -- ports to new systems, providers for new languages and development of new DTrace-based tools -- the time is long overdue for a DTrace summit of sorts. So I'm very pleased to announce our first-ever DTrace (un)conference: **[dtrace.conf(08)](http://wikis.sun.com/display/DTrace/dtrace.conf)**, to be held in San Francisco on March 14, 2008. One of the most gratifying aspects of DTrace is its community: because DTrace operates both across abstraction boundaries and to great depth, it naturally attracts technologists who do the same -- systems generalists who couple an ability to think abstractly about the system with a thirst for the concrete data necessary to better understand it. So if nothing else, dtrace.conf should provide for thought-provoking and wide-ranging conversation!

The [conference wiki](http://wikis.sun.com/display/DTrace/dtrace.conf) has more details; hope to see you at **dtrace.conf** in San Francisco in March!
