<table><tbody><tr><td valign="center"><img src="images/alexander_smiling.jpg"></td><td width="10px"></td><td>Our family is very happy to welcome its newest addition: Alexander Morgan Gaffikin Cantrill, born on June 17th at 3:22pm, and weighing in at a whopping 9 pounds, 7 ounces. (And that was five days early!) It's amazing how much one forgets over <a href="/2004/09/28/tobin-cormac-gaffikin-cantrill/">nearly three years</a>; I've found myself cramming on forgotten (if simple) ideas like burping and "tummy time". (But I can still swaddle like an all-pro!)</td></tr></tbody></table>
