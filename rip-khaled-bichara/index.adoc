= RIP Khaled Bichara, 1971-2020

We were deeply saddened to learn that
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Bichara[Khaled Bichara], one of Oxide's
angel investors,
https://www.menabytes.com/khaled-bichara-dies-car-accident/[died in a car
accident in Cairo on Friday night].

Those of us who have known Khaled for years have known him to be a bold investor
who appreciated hard technical problems – and also a profoundly decent person,
who cared deeply for his family, his companies, and his country. Khaled's
stories of kindling entrepreneurship in Egypt were inspiring to any who heard
them – and served as a reminder of the reponsibility that we all have to our
broader communities. Our most recent conversation with Khaled – just a few
short months ago – remains vivid: he was excited by our technical vision and
thrilled to be a part of Oxide. For our part, we were looking forward to a long
journey together, and to making good on his belief in us; we are gutted to have
lost him so abruptly. Our heart goes out to his family, and to all those who he
touched over his career; Silicon Valley may be a long way from Cairo, but his
impact and https://waya.media/the-legacy-of-khaled-bichara/[legacy] will be felt
here for years to come.
